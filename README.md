# Polyglot Dev Notes: A Full-Stack Cookbook

## About This Project

This repository serves as my **personal knowledge base** and a **comparative learning journal**, documenting my journey through various full-stack technologies. Inspired by resources like [Hyperpolyglot](https://hyperpolyglot.org/) and transitioning from component-based frameworks like Adianti, the goal is to compare how modern stacks like **Laravel**, **Django**, and **full-stack JavaScript** solve the same real-world problems.

**Note:** I'm using this repository to document my process of solidifying existing skills and learning new ones. Feel free to open an issue with any feedback or suggestions!

## My Learning Goals

-   **Active Learning**: To solidify my understanding by documenting concepts, code patterns, and architectural decisions.
-   **Quick Reference**: To build a personal, "go-to" guide for practical, idiomatic solutions across different technology stacks.
-   **Comparative Analysis**: To understand the fundamental trade-offs between frameworks regarding development speed, architecture, and ecosystem.
-   **Portfolio Building**: To showcase a structured learning process and a deep interest in software architecture to the international community.

## How This Repository is Structured

Unlike a typical snippet collection, this repository is organized by **concept** rather than by language. This allows for a direct, side-by-side comparison of how different frameworks implement the same functionality.

The main directories represent the core pillars of web application development:
/
├── 01-Setup-and-Environment/
├── 02-Language-Fundamentals/
├── 03-Persistence-and-ORM/
├── 04-Routing-and-Controllers/
├── 05-Presentation-and-Templates/
├── 06-Forms-and-Validation/
├── 07-Lists-and-Components/
└── ...and so on

Each folder contains specific Markdown files for each technology stack (e.g., `laravel-eloquent.md`, `django-orm.md`), detailing the implementation of that concept.

## Current Stacks in Focus

-   **PHP**: Laravel (with Filament for RAD)
-   **Python**: Django
-   **JavaScript**: NestJS (Backend) & Next.js/React (Frontend)
-   **Mobile**: Flutter & React Native

## How to Contribute

This is currently a personal learning project. As it matures, I may open it up for contributions. For now, feel free to **open an issue** if you spot a mistake or have a suggestion for improvement. All feedback is welcome!
