## 📌 About This Repository  

I started my career with **CA-Clipper**, **PowerBuilder**, and some **PHP**, and now I’m revisiting and upgrading my skills to **modern stacks**.  

The goals of this repository are to:  
- Keep concepts fresh in my memory.  
- Practice multiple programming languages and frameworks.  
- Compare different approaches to solving the same problem.  
- Build **ready-to-use reference code** for future projects.
